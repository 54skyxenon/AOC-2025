# Advent of Code 2025

I'm back for AoC 2025, this time in Perl!

## Input
All input is read from TXT files under the `inputs/` folder that you need to make prior to executing any code.

## Environment Details
My Perl version:
```bash
$ perl --version

This is perl 5, version 34, subversion 1 (v5.34.1) built for darwin-thread-multi-2level
(with 2 registered patches, see perl -V for more detail)

To execute a specific Perl file I do:
```bash
$ perl hello.pl
Hello, World!
```

I also have [glpk](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) installed for some days needing it:
```
brew install glpk
```
